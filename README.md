## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice**

Microsoft is retiring Azure TURN services, which are used by the Azure TTS Avatar for communication. To ensure continuity, this project includes a script to set up your own TURN server:

- Execute the `installCoturn.sh` script on an Ubuntu instance to configure your TURN server.
- For detailed guidance, refer to this article: [Azure Avatar TTS Update](https://raokarthik83.medium.com/azure-avatar-tts-update-migrating-from-azure-turn-to-coturn-14b6ac86d60c).
